## MY WEBSITE


This project is a dynamic portfolio website built with React inspired by my love for Disney.  
It incorporates Material-UI (MUI) for styling and theming, along with custom React components to bring a magical and engaging experience to life.

### Features

1. **Mouse Follower Component:**  
   Displays an image that follows the user's cursor.  
   Updates dynamically based on the selected theme.

2. **Theming System:**  
   Users can switch between three themes: "Beauty and the Beast," "Frozen," and "Wicked."
   The theme affects the cursor image and global application styles.

3. **Interactive UI:**  
    Dropdown menu for selecting themes.  
    Smooth user interaction with real-time updates.
